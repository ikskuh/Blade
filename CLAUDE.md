# CLAUDE.md — Blade Compiler Project

## What is Blade?

Blade compiles to PASM2 (Propeller 2 assembly) targeting COG execution mode.
Every construct maps to 1–3 PASM2 instructions. Language spec: `Docs/reference.blade`.

## Host Tools

- **`dotnet`** — .NET SDK (build + test).
- **`flexspin`** (v6.9.10+) — validates emitted PASM2. Use `-2 -c -q` for Prop2 DAT-only assembly; exit code 0 = success.

Emitted PASM must be wrapped in a DAT block (`DAT` / `org 0`) for FlexSpin to accept it.

## Architecture

C#, NUnit, handrolled recursive descent parser.

Pipeline: Lexer → Parser (AST) → Semantic analysis (typed AST, CC tiering) → SSA lowering (backwards reg alloc) → Codegen (PASM2 text).

Each stage independently testable.

## Coding Style

- Prefer clarity over brevity. No `var` where the type isn't obvious from the RHS.
- Result types / error returns for expected failures. Exceptions only for bugs.
- Every runtime error path handled, never swallowed.
- `Debug.Assert` for invariants guaranteed by earlier stages — never write unreachable fallback code.
- Argument validation via `Blade/Requires.cs` (`Requires.NotNull`, `.NonNegative`, `.Positive`, `.InRange`).
- `Blade/.editorconfig` is the analyzer rule source of truth.
- In-source suppressions (`#pragma`, attributes) only for single occurrences with a clear explanation.

## Syntax & Grammar Changes

- **`Docs/reference.blade` is the syntax authority.** Do not invent syntax not in the reference.
- Mirror syntax changes into `VSCode/blade-lang/syntaxes/blade.tmLanguage.json`.
- Parser/lexer changes require corresponding test updates in `Blade.Tests/`.

## Diagnostics

Every diagnostic needs: numeric code (`E`/`W`/`I` prefix), human-readable name, format string.

## Finding Bugs

When something unexpected happens or a compiler bug emerges, immediately log it into `Work/Bugs.md`. Otherwise the bug will be lost forever.

When code appears unreachable, immediately log it into `Work/Unreachable.md`.

## Testing

Always prefer a new code sample in `Demonstrators/` over a dedicated unit test in `Blade.Tests`.
A unit test asserts code, a Demonstrator asserts compiler compliance.

**100% branch coverage required.** Run `just coverage`; query uncovered lines:
`python Scripts/coverage_range.py <class_pattern> <start_line> <end_line>`.

Prefer writing a demonstrator file over a unit test to reach coverage.

The regression harness `Blade.Regressions` is fully integrated into the test suite
in `Blade.Tests/RegressionHarnessTests.cs` (`FullRegressionSuite_Passes`) and allows
collecting coverage information from the regression suite as well.

Code paths that are not provably reachable through the compiler frontend are dead code and shall be
replaced with assertions.

### Regression Harness (`Blade.Regressions`)

Main behavioral gate. Discovers fixtures under `Examples/`, `Demonstrators/`, `RegressionTests/`.
Matches diagnostics and codegen against header expectations; validates assembly via FlexSpin.

- `Examples/` — pristine, no headers, zero diagnostics only.
- `Demonstrators/` — may have expectation headers, part of regression corpus.
- `RegressionTests/` — focused bug/diagnostic/assembly fixtures.
- `EXPECT: fail` — malformed or semantically invalid programs.
- `EXPECT: xfail` — valid programs that fail due to known compiler gaps.

Header format: `Docs/TestHarness.md`.

### Other Tests

- `Blade.Tests/Accept` and `Blade.Tests/Reject` — focused NUnit parser/binder diagnostic coverage.
- Unit tests in `Blade.Tests/` — use `Blade.Tests/TempDirectory` for filesystem access.
- **Never use ad-hoc temp files.** Create demonstrator/regression files and use `just compile-sample <path>` or `just regressions`.

### Build Hygiene

Builds must be **warning-free**. New warnings are regressions.
